## **Research**

Currently, I am working on **Network Pruning in ViT** and the **Incremental Learning problem**. Apart from that I have a good level of research expertise in **Knowledge Distillation, Vision Language Models and Neural Representation Learning**.

Here are some of my published (and accepted) research works.

### 1. **Background-Invariant Independence-Guided Multi-head Attention Network for Skin Lesion Classification** \[First Author]

**MICCAI 2025 (International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention)**

Biomedical image classification faces several adversarial challenges, including occlusions from artifacts, variations in tissue pigmentation, and class imbalance, which hinder model generalization. Existing attention mechanisms enhance region localization but often introduce redundant dependencies across attention heads, limiting feature diversity.

We propose the **Background-Invariant Independence-Guided Multi-head Attention Network (BIIGMA-Net)** to address these issues. BIIGMA-Net employs **Multi-head Independence-Guided Channel Attention (MICA)**, where each head independently learns feature importance while enforcing neuron-wise independence using the **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)** to enhance feature diversity.

Additionally, a **saliency-driven mechanism** suppresses background activations by selectively shuffling non-salient vectors, preventing the model from relying on static background cues. By integrating these strategies, BIIGMA-Net improves robustness against spurious background noise while ensuring complementary feature extraction.

Extensive experiments on popular skin cancer datasets (**ISIC-17, ISIC-18 and ISIC-19**) demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and robustness.

### 2. **Multi-headed Graph-Based Attention Aided U-Net Model for Nuclei Segmentation** \[Third Author]

**International Conference on Neural Information Processing 2024**

Accurate segmentation of nuclei in histopathology images is critical for understanding tissue morphology and aiding in disease diagnosis, particularly cancer. However, this task is challenging due to the high variability in staining and diverse morphological features.

In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates a **graph-based attention mechanism into the U-Net architecture**. Our method utilizes a state-of-the-art encoder backbone and introduces a **Pairwise Node Similarity Attention Module (PNSAM)**, which computes the similarity between feature channels using a kernel function that inherently applies a dot product to capture spatial information.

This module enhances the relationships between local and non-local feature vectors within a feature map obtained from multiple encoder layers, forming a graph attention map. Additionally, we incorporate a **channel pruning mechanism** that leverages predefined statistical knowledge to select important individual channels for graph attention map creation.

The resulting graph attention map enhances encoder features for skip connections. Furthermore, we combine activated features from multiple trainable PNSAM heads to generate a more diverse and robust feature map.

We evaluated our novel architecture on three widely recognized datasets: **Monuseg, TNBC, and CryoNuSeg**. Our method outperformed various state-of-the-art approaches on each dataset, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness in nuclei segmentation tasks.

### 3. **Margin-Aware Adaptive-Weighted-Loss for Deep Learning Based Imbalanced Data Classification** \[First Author]

**IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence ¬∑ May 11, 2023**

In supervised learning algorithms, the class imbalance problem often leads to generate results biased towards the majority classes. Present methods used to deal with the class imbalance problem ignore a principal aspect of separating the overlapping classes. This is the reason why most of these methods are prone to overfit on the training data.

To this end, we propose a novel loss function, namely **Margin-Aware Adaptive-Weighted (MAAW) Loss**. Here, we first use the **large margin softmax** to leverage intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Further, to learn an unbiased representation of the classes, we put forward a **dynamically weighted loss for imbalanced data classification**.

This weight dynamically adapts on every minibatch based on the inverse class frequencies. In addition, it takes care of the hard-to-train samples by using the confidence scores to learn discriminative hidden representations of the data.

The overall framework is found to be effective when evaluated on two widely used datasets, namely **CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST**. Additional experiments on **HAM10000 and APTOS-2019 BD** datasets prove the robustness of our methodology.
